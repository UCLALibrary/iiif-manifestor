/**
 * <p>Metadata information given as pairs of human readable label and value to be displayed to the user.
 * The value should be either simple HTML, including links and text markup, or plain text, and the label should be plain
 * text. There are no semantics conveyed by this information, and clients should not use it for discovery or other
 * purposes. This list of descriptive pairs should be able to be displayed in a tabular form in the user interface.
 * Clients should have a way to display the information about manifests and canvases, and may have a way to view the
 * information about other resources. The client should display the pairs in the order provided by the description. A
 * pair might be used to convey the author of the work, information about its creation, a brief physical description, or
 * ownership information, amongst other use cases. The client is not expected to take any action on this information
 * beyond displaying the label and value. An example pair of label and value might be a label of “Author” and a value of
 * “Jehan Froissart”.</p>
