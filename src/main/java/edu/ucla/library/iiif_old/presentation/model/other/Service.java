/**
 * <p>
 * A link to a service that makes more functionality available for the resource, such as from an image to the base URI
 * of an associated IIIF Image API service. The service resource should have additional information associated with it
 * in order to allow the client to determine how to make appropriate use of it, such as a profile link to a service
 * description. It may also have relevant information copied from the service itself. This duplication is permitted in
 * order to increase the performance of rendering the object without necessitating additional HTTP requests.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * Please see the <a href="http://iiif.io/api/annex/services/">Service Profiles document</a> for known services.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * Services may be included either by reference or embedded within the response. The decision as to whether to embed
 * or reference is left up to the implementer, however embedded descriptions should be kept as short as possible. If
 * the only properties of the object are @context, @id, profile and/or label, then the client should retrieve the
 * resource from the URI given in @id.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * Example: <pre>
 * {
 *   "service": {
 *     "@context": "http://example.org/ns/jsonld/context.json",
 *     "@id": "http://example.org/service/example.json",
 *     "profile": "http://example.org/docs/example-service.html",
 *     "label": "Example Service"
 *     // Additional keys may be embedded here, if not then the @id should be retrieved
 *   }
 * }
 * </pre>
